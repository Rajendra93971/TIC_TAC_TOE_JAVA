# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game written in Java. The game allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid,
where the first player to align three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend.
- **Interactive Console Input**: Players can choose their move by entering grid coordinates.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects winning combinations and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: The game also detects when there is no possible winner (i.e., a draw).
- **User-Friendly**: Clear instructions and easy-to-follow game prompts.

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a grid of 3x3 squares.
2. Players take turns to place their mark ('X' or 'O') in an empty square.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language used to implement the game logic.

## Code Structure
The game is designed in a simple structure:

- **Main.java**: Contains the core game logic, player input handling, and the main method that initiates the game.

## Future Enhancements
- **Single-Player Mode**: Add an AI opponent to play against the computer.
